# homebrew-patches

My "taps" for Mac Homebrew formulae which have patches not accepted by mxcl/homebrew.

### Usage

You can access this repository using `brew tap`:

    brew tap dennisdegreef/patches
    brew install ...

Since these formulae will likely have collisions with standard mxcl/homebrew formulae, you can:

    brew install dennisdegreef/patches/<formula>
